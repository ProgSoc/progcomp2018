<h2>How to prepare</h2>

<p>The best way to prepare for the Competition is, of course, to <i>practice</i>!</p>

<h3>Individual preparation</h3>

<p>This would involve familiarising yourself with, and becoming adept at:</p> 

<ol>
<li>at least one of the four official programming languages (C/C++, Java and Python);</li>
<li>how to read from standard input and write to standard output in your language(s) of choice;</li>
<li>the <a href="icpc.html">ICPC</a> question format, examples of which are provided on this page (the Competition intentionally follows the ICPC format);</li>
<li>as many data structures and algorithms as possible, and knowing how and where to apply them -- this is what the Competition is <i>really</i> all about!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Team preparation</h3>

<p>You will also need to learn how to work effectively as a team, so doing practice contests with your team mates, be it at home or even in the CB11.B1 labs or the CB11.05 FLP, is essential to success.</p>

<p>You and your team will be subjected to the following constraints during the Competition:</p>

<ol>
<li>You will only have one computer -- one monitor, one keyboard, one mouse -- at your disposal.</li>
<li>You will only have four hours to attempt the problems.</li>
<li>You will not have access to the Internet.</li>
<!--li>You will have a printer to print your code with, however.</li-->
</ol>

<p>This necessitates coming up with some kind of time and resource management strategy. There are two or three of you in your team. All of you need to be active participants.</p>

<p>It is actually possible to be working on more than one problem at a time! Start by unstapling the problem set booklet. While one team mate is typing a solution to one problem, another could be scribbling a pseudocode algorithm for another problem. <!--If you get stuck on a problem while coding it -- don't waste time! Print out your work in progress, so that a team mate can pore over it in an attempt to debug the code, while working on another problem.--></p>

<p>While you are not allowed to use the Internet, you are allowed to bring text books and printouts of resources. You should also assemble a manila folder filled with printouts of useful code samples, algorithms and mathematical theorems. Ideally you will have an understanding of said algorithms and theorems before competing. A sample folder is provided on this page.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<h3>Programming Competition Tips</h3>

<p><a href="http://progsoc.org/wiki/Programming_Competition_Tips">Includes information on how to compile and run programs written in the official Competition languages, as well how to read from standard input.</a></p>

<h3>Example Problems</h3>

<p>To cater for a variety of ability levels, the Competition problem set will consist of a mix of easy problems and difficult problems.</p>

<h4>Easy Problems</h4>

<p>These will be set at the level of <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems. </p>

<p>Example:</p> 

<p>Write a program that adds all the natural numbers (i.e. positive integers) below one thousand that are multiples of 3 or 5. <a href="http://progsoc.org/wiki?title=Euler_Solution_1&oldid=4747">Possible solutions</a>.</p>

<h4>Difficult Problems</h4>

<p>These will be set at the level of ACM ICPC Regional Competition Problems.</p> 

<p>A few examples:</p>
