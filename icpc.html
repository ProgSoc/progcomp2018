				In addition to winning prize money in the Competition, teams who have performed well (<a href="EligibilityDecisionTree-2019.pdf">and are eligible to do so</a>) will be invited to represent UTS in the International Collegiate Programming Contest, or <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/">ICPC</a>.
         </p>

         <p>The ICPC is a multi-stage contest. The UTS Programming Competition is the first stage.</p>

         <p>The second stage is the <b>Divisional Round</b>, which will take place on the <b>20th of October</b> at the <b>University of Sydney</b>. Teams from UTS shall compete against other teams from universities in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The top four universities from this region (which could include UTS) will advance to the next stage.</p>

         <p>The third stage is the <b>Regional Round</b>, which will take place on the <b>23rd and 24th of November</b> at the <b>University of New South Wales</b>. A minimum of 12 teams from all over Australia and New Zealand shall compete in this round. The top two universities from this round (which, again, <i>could include UTS</i>!) will advance to the next stage.</p>

         <p>The fourth, and final stage is the <b>World Finals</b>, which will take place in 2019 in an as-yet-to-be-announced location. There will be in excess of 130 teams from universities all over the world. To date, no team from UTS has made it to the World Finals, so getting to this stage would be an achievement in and of itself -- it would certainly look good on your resume!</p>
