<h4>Can I use C#, JavaScript, or my all-time favourite language ever in the competition?</h4>

<p>This year's competition will only accept Java, C/C++ or Python solutions. Yes, it's time to hit the textbooks again if it's been a while. Look on the bright side, if you decide to participate in the ICPC, you've done your basic revision already!</p>

<h4>Do we supply input via standard input, files, or arguments on the command line?</h4>

<p>All input will be from standard input, and all output will be to standard output. No arguments will be passed to your program at the command line. No files will be opened for reading or writing. </p>

<h4>I have a feeling the system may say my solution is incorrect even though I've met the expected output. Why?</h4>

<p>The marking system is a machine, not a person, and will treat the extra output of your solution, such as human-friendly prompts, as 'incorrect'; it is whitespace-sensitive and case-sensitive.</p>

<h4>How is the 'total elapsed time' calculated in this contest?</h4>

<p>When a correct submission is made to the adjudicators, the number of minutes elapsed since the beginning of the contest at the time of the correct submission is recorded.</p>

<h4>Do we program on provided computers or use our own?</h4>

<p>We'll be using the computer labs in Building 11. The lab computers will be used to keep the competition fair.</p>

<h4>Which text editors and IDEs will be available for use in the labs?</h4>

<p>gedit, nano, vim, emacs, Eclipse and BlueJ.</p>

<h4>Can we use Windows on the lab computers?</h4>

<p>No. Linux (Red Hat, to be exact) will be used, which is the default, on the computer labs. If you have not used the lab computers in Building 11 before, it is recommended you do so before the competition. If you choose to ignore this recommendation and choose Windows at login during the competition, you are wasting precious time -- it will not work; Windows will not load. And even if you did, you will need to be mindful of carriage return differences between Windows and Linux systems in your output (i.e. \n instead of \r\n).</p>

<h4>Why haven't I registered yet!?</h4>

<p>No idea...</p>
